        I am very interested in the technical field, especially in roles like
        Technical Officer. I find the idea of working with innovative
        technologies and solving complex problems exciting. I believe that the
        technical field offers endless opportunities for growth and development.
        Additionally, I am also interested in starting my own business one day.
        I am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skills in both
        technical areas and entrepreneurship.
